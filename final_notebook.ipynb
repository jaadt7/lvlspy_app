The expression $(f_{1}^{in})^{T}(I - F^{T})^{-1}f_{2}^{out}$ from $\\lambda_{21}^{eff}$ is actually the effective branching ratio in terms of Graph Theory. The \"cascade probability vectors\" are defined as $\\Gamma_{q}^{in} = (I - F)^{-1}f_{q}^{in}$. The term cascade refers to the de-excitation from higher states into state 'q'. The paper also defines the 'infinite'-arc generalization of $f_{q}^{out}$ with $\\Gamma_{q}^{out} = (I - F^{T})^{-1}f_{q}^{out}$. They then go through the proof to rewrite $\\lambda_{21}^{eff} = (\\lambda_{2}^{out})^{T}\\Gamma_{1}^{in}$. Here we sample over temperatures chosen in table 4 from the paper to compare the values of $W_{1}(T)$, $W_{2}(T)$, $G_{1}(T)$, and $G_{2}(T)$, as well as $\\lambda_{21}^{eff}$. By comparing the values to those in the paper, there is good agreement in between the factors listed above for values of $T_{9}$ up to 1.0. The deviation with higher values of and about $T_{9}$ are due to the fact that the xml used contains only 22 levels while the paper's calculation is using 67."
