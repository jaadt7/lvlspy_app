The expression $(f_{1}^{in})^{T}(I - F^{T})^{-1}f_{2}^{out}$ from $\\lambda_{21}^{eff}$ is actually the effective branching ratio in terms of Graph Theory. The \"cascade probability vectors\" are defined as $\\Gamma_{q}^{in} = (I - F)^{-1}f_{q}^{in}$. The term cascade refers to the de-excitation from higher states into state 'q'. The paper also defines the 'infinite'-arc generalization of $f_{q}^{out}$ with $\\Gamma_{q}^{out} = (I - F^{T})^{-1}f_{q}^{out}$.

If two states have the same fugacity, they will not exchange abundances. Equilibrium is established when all states have the same fugacity of one."
